# BLE Custom Service Example for Nordic nRF51 Development Kit
Adaptation of the BLE_LBS custom service example to work with nRF51 DK.

see the nAN-36 application note [here](https://www.nordicsemi.com/eng/nordic/Products/nRF51822/nAN-36/24020)


#objective
To port the nAN-36 example of how to create a custom BLE service to the nRF51 development kit. I tested the service using LightBlue for iPhone, but you can use any BLE servicing app that can write to/read from and receive notifications from BLE services.
